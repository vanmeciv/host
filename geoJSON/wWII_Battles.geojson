                "description": "The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest continuous military campaign of World War II, (though some say it was a series of naval military campaigns and offensives running from 1939 through to the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, and was at its height from mid-1940 through to the end of 1943. The Battle of the Atlantic pitted U-boats and other warships of the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) against Allied convoys. The convoys, coming mainly from North America and the South Atlantic and going to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, were protected for the most part by the British and Canadian navies and air forces. These forces were aided by ships and aircraft of the United States from 13 September 1941. The Germans were joined by submarines of the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) after Italy entered the war on June 10, 1940.<br>(Source: Wikipedia) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic_%281939%E2%80%931945%29)<br><br>More World War II Resources: http://www.everythingworldwar2.com"

It was, in fact, a series of battles fought around Kasserine Pass, a two-mile (3 km) wide gap in the Grand Dorsal chain of the Atlas Mountains in west central Tunisia. The Axis forces involved were primarily from the German-Italian Panzer Army (the redesignated German Panzer Army Africa) led by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and two Panzer divisions attached from the Fifth Panzer Army. The Allied forces involved came mostly from the U.S. Army's II Corps commanded by Major General Lloyd Fredendall, which was part of the British First Army commanded by Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson.<br>(Source: Wikipedia) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Kasserine_Pass)<br><br>More World War II Resources:<br>http://www.everythingworldwar2.com"

In order to reach it before the Allies could regroup and bring their superior air power to bear, German mechanized forces had to seize the roadways through eastern Belgium. Because all seven main roads in the Ardennes mountain range converged on the small town of Bastogne, control of its crossroads was vital to the German attack. The siege lasted from December 20 to December 27 when the besieged American forces were relieved by elements of General Patton's Third Army.
